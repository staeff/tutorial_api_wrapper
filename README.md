# An API Wrapper in Python

This is an example for a library that helps you abstract away the API's implementation details.
With this API wrapper for the movie database (tmdb.com) you access the API through calling regular 
methods in Python, rather than constructing HTTP requests from scratch. An API wrapper also has 
the advantage of returning data as familiar data structures, hence enabling idiomatic ways to 
access and manipulate this data.

The code is developed test driven and follows the tutorial https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/building-and-testing-an-api-wrapper-in-python

## Objectives of the tutorial

* How to create and test a custom library which communicates with a third-party API and

* How to use the custom library in a Python script.
